a simple website for joe's cleaning service!

WHY DOES THIS EXIST?

I met a man named Joe who runs a cleaning service and when questioned about his online presence he said he's relied on word of mouth thus far. I think it's time to bring his shining, gleaming company into this century by creating a customer acquisition and information Single Page Application!

Here's how I plan to do this (I'll update this as I make progress!):

1. Create a simple SPA barebones frame to hold the content! I'll be using angular.js and some gulp goodness to help with the development tasks and processes.
2. SIMPLE START with the data. Without the model, the controller and views are worthless templates!
3. Add basic controllers and views to supplement the page with data!
